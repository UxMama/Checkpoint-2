## Ranking: Low, Medium, High

The *Discovery Phase* is something that I have had lots of experience in. My experience ranges from customer relations to the appearance of a retail store to ensure a pleasant experience for shoppers. It is definitely different from Design and Front End Development but I believe the same process in finding out what the problem is, finding your audience etc. **Rank: High**

*Strategy Phase*, is something I have had a bit of experience in but not necessarily in the design industry. There have been situations in which myself and my team had to look at what was alrady established, what was working and what was not working. Interviewing current customers and finding our potential customers and interviwing them. **Rank: Medium** 

*Information Architecture*: I have never done this before and am very new to this process. **Rank: low**

*Visual Design* is a very new process for me as well. I have read and studied the way colors affect people when searching the web but have not gotten past that. **Rank: low**

*Development Phase* is also a new process for me. I have attempted to learn coding on my own and enjoy it but also find myself stuck, finding it hard to retain the infor but when I figure it out its a great feeling! **Rank: low**

*Launch Phase* - I have had a chance to show my final work and put it in the hands of the public such as a Customer Reward Program, Small Business support programs but nothing technical or in design. **Rank: low**
